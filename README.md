# DriftoutIO

**A fast-paced royle/racing game inspired by driftin.io built with socket.io, p5js and node.js.

*This is not currently hosted online due to very early development. You can however run the latest version locally but there are a few steps.

**How to Run:

1. Install npm package manager (If you haven't already!)
2. Install Node js
3. Install Express and Socket.io libraries using npm in terminal (npm install express / npm install socket.io)
4. Run the local node server in terminal with "node *LocalDirectory*\DriftoutIO\Driftout\server\server.js"
5. Open a localhost tab on port 3000 in your preferred web browser ("localhost:3000" as the address)
