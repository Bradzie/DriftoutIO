# DriftoutIO

## A fast-paced royle/racing game inspired by driftin.io built with socket.io, p5js and node.js

The game finally has independent hosting and a custom domain!

! https://driftout.io !

## Battle other racers to be the first to complete 20 laps! 🚗

> Select from 7 different car classes each with different attributes and some with abilities ⚔️

> Complete laps to upgrade your car and survive longer ⬆️

> Play solo to attempt for a personal best time 💨

## How to run locally:

1. Install Node js for your relevant system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install npm package manager (It should come installed with node.js, dependant on your specific download)
3. Install Express and Socket.io libraries using npm in terminal ("npm install express" / "npm install socket.io")
4. Run the local node server in terminal with "node _WhereverYouPutIt_\DriftoutIO\Driftout\server\server.js"
5. Open a localhost tab on port 80 in your preferred web browser ("localhost:80" as the address)
6. *Optional* You can also open a tab with your current network's ip followed by :80 (e.g. 1.1.1.1:80) to access the website from different machines

## Bugs:

There are currently multiple bugs on list to be corrected one by one - I will update this list as often as I can so it stays relevant.

1. Rapid refresh of the page causes issues new players to be created with null x and y values
2. CSS Main menu container and title scrambles on smaller screens
3. Sometimes, but rarely, lap checkpoints can be completely missed
