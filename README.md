# DriftoutIO

## A fast-paced royle/racing game inspired by driftin.io built with socket.io, p5js and node.js

The game finally has independent hosting and a custom domain!

! https://driftout.io !

## Battle other racers to be the first to complete 20 laps! 🚗

> Select from 7 different car classes each with different attributes and some with abilities ⚔️

> Complete laps to upgrade your car and survive longer ⬆️

> Play solo to attempt for a personal best time 💨

## How to run locally:

1. Install Node js for your relevant system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install npm package manager (It should come installed with node.js, dependant on your specific download)
3. Install Express and Socket.io libraries using npm in terminal ("npm install express" / "npm install socket.io")
4. Run the local node server in terminal with "node _WhereverYouPutIt_\DriftoutIO\Driftout\server\server.js"
5. Open a localhost tab on port 80 in your preferred web browser ("localhost:80" as the address)
6. *Optional* You can also open a tab with your current network's ip followed by :80 (e.g. 1.1.1.1:80) to access the website from different machines

## Version info:

I'm slowly approaching the planned criteria I had imagined months ago when I had just started development. Version numbers allow me to reflect how close I am to what I feel is the a release.

V0.6 All upgrades functional   <--- We are here :)
V0.7 Optimise GUI
v0.8 Mobile integration
v0.9 10 Classes, 4 Maps
V1.0 Round modifiers


## Bugs:

There are currently multiple bugs on list to be corrected one by one - I will update this list as often as I can so it stays relevant.

1. Rapid refresh of the page causes issues new players to be created with null x and y values
2. Completely unplayable on mobile
3. Sometimes, but rarely, lap checkpoints can be completely missed (likely due to the size of checkpoint triggers)
4. Upgrade selections rapidly select with more than one point
5.
